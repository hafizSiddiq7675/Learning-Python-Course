    "## Forking a Project on GitHub\n",
    "\n",
    "Forking a project essentially means creating a copy of the project under your own account. Follow the steps below to fork a project on GitHub:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Visit the Repository**:\n",
    "   - Open your web browser and navigate to the GitHub page of the project/repository you want to fork.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Login to GitHub**:\n",
    "   - If you aren't logged in already, click on the \"Sign in\" button on the top right of the page and provide your credentials.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Fork the Repository**:\n",
    "   - At the top-right corner of the page, you'll see a button labeled \"Fork\". Click on it.\n",
    "   - GitHub will create a copy of the repository in your personal GitHub account.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Clone Your Fork** (Optional):\n",
    "   - Navigate to your fork on GitHub.\n",
    "   - Click on the \"Code\" button (usually green) and copy the URL.\n",
    "   - Open a terminal or command prompt on your computer and navigate to where you want to clone the repository.\n",
    "   - Type the following, replacing `[URL]` with the URL you copied:\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     git clone [URL]\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   - This will create a local copy on your machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Set Upstream** (Recommended if you cloned):\n",
    "   - Navigate to your cloned directory:\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     cd repo-name\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   - Add the original repository as an upstream remote:\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     git remote add upstream https://github.com/original-owner/repo-name.git\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   - Check that the upstream was added successfully:\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     git remote -v\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, you've successfully forked a project! You can make changes in your fork and if you wish to contribute back, you can create a pull request to the original repository."

    "## Creating a Pull Request on GitHub\n",
    "\n",
    "Follow the steps below to create a pull request:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Ensure Local Branch is Up to Date**:\n",
    "   - Before submitting a pull request, make sure your branch is up to date with the upstream/master or the branch from which you branched off.\n",
    "     ```bash\n",
    "     git pull upstream master\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Push Your Changes**:\n",
    "   - Push your changes to your remote repository on GitHub.\n",
    "     ```bash\n",
    "     git push origin your-branch-name\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Navigate to Your Fork on GitHub**:\n",
    "   - Go to your GitHub page and select your fork of the repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Start a New Pull Request**:\n",
    "   - Click on the \"New pull request\" button next to your branch dropdown.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Select Base and Compare Branches**:\n",
    "   - The \"base repository\" should be the original repository you forked from.\n",
    "   - \"base\" will be the branch you want to merge your changes into, usually `master` or `main`.\n",
    "   - \"head repository\" should be your fork.\n",
    "   - \"compare\" should be the branch you made your changes in.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. **Review Your Changes**:\n",
    "   - GitHub will show an overview of the changes you made. Ensure everything looks correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. **Add a Descriptive Title and Comment**:\n",
    "   - Your title should summarize the changes you made.\n",
    "   - Your comment should provide more details about the changes, the reason for them, and any other relevant information reviewers might need.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. **Create the Pull Request**:\n",
    "   - Click \"Create pull request\".\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9. **Address Feedback**:\n",
    "   - If reviewers ask for changes, make the changes in your branch, commit them, and push them. The pull request will automatically update with your new commits.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 10. **Merging the Pull Request**:\n",
    "   - Once your pull request has been reviewed and approved, a maintainer of the original repository will merge it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, a pull request is not just about submitting code. It's also a conversation. Communicate with your reviewers, address feedback, and your contributions will be appreciated!\n"

Finally, you’ll have the opportunity to fix bugs that were exposed by your tests.\n",
