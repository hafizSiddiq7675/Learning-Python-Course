It is based on the concept of the procedure call, where data is passed into a procedure (or function), which then performs some action and possibly returns some data. Procedural programming structures the code into procedures that are often highly reusable, and the state of the program is determined by global data that are accessible to all procedures. Examples of procedural languages include C, Pascal, and Fortran."
